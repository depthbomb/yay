# yay

_yay_ (**Y**et **A**nother **Y**ouTube Downloader) is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based GUI wrapper around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for Windows that runs in the system tray.

## Installation

yay can be installed by downloading and running the latest setup in [releases](https://github.com/depthbomb/yay/releases/latest).

Upon first run, yay will automatically download and the latest version of yt-dlp if it isn't found in your system's PATH. It will also download and use [yt-dlp's builds of FFmpeg and FFprobe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds).


## Planned features

- [ ] Allow customizing yt-dlp options when downloading
- [ ] Move yt-dlp stdout to its own window, simplifying home screen
- [ ] Improved download completion notifying
- [ ] Application update checking
